# Reflex App in Android Studio using Firebase
**Project description:**

Creating a mobile application whose main purpose will be to measure response time. The measurement is performed by clicking a highlighted button on a screen divided into four parts. Each part has a different color and the order in which they appear is random. The measurement result is the average reaction time of all clicks during one session. The application also has a connected database that will store users' results, including the name of the subject and the date of measurement. The application allows you to choose the duration of the test.

**Target group:**

The application is aimed primarily at people suspected of suffering from diseases of the nervous system. People who want to improve their reaction time (improve brain function) can also use this application. The application will work well for all types of clinical tests, e.g. testing people under the influence of drugs or medications.

**Challenges in creating the application (Project goals):**

- Creation of a clear and user-friendly graphical interface

- Database implementation

- Creation of appropriate methods to measure reaction time

- Obtaining reliable results allowing for further analysis
